## Introduction

### What is Git?

Why write a definition when you can simply lift one from Wikipedia[^1]?

[^1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>

> Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

In simple terms: software is simply a collection of text files with lines of code in them, and adding to a software project essentially amounts to adding and removing different lines of code. Git provides a way to track these modifications, and to bring together multiple sets of modifications from different developers: even when they have all (unbeknownst to them) been working on the same lines of code.

It is most useful when working with others, but Git is also useful when working solo, since each modification can essentially be considered a snapshot of the project's progress, and this can be restored with ease.

### What is GitHub?

::: callout-important
Git and GitHub are not the same thing! This cannot be overstated.
:::

If you're going to be working on a software project, using Git, with other developers, you need somewhere to store the "official" version of your code: to which individual developers will make changes as and when features are added.

A bewildering number of developers use [GitHub](https://github.com){target="_blank"} for this purpose; the purpose being to act as a *remote repository* on which to store code.

Alternatives (such as [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/){target="_blank"} and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product){target="_blank"}), but they are nowhere near as widely used as GitHub.

## Basic Git commands

Git is an extremely powerful, and at times [dangerously confusing](https://ohshitgit.com/){target="_blank"} tool, but you can get surprisingly far with very few commands.

::: callout-tip
This is a far from comprehensive list of Git commands. See [Further Reading](#further-reading) for more thorough guides
:::

In order to learn about them, you first need a repository to work with. In order to do this, you're going to *fork* (basically create a copy) of one I created earlier:

<btn> <a href="https://github.com/gtm19/r-intro-exercises/fork"> Fork my repo </a> </btn>

You should now see a copy of this repository on your GitHub account. The next task is to download a copy to work on on your machine. For that, we need `git clone`.

### `git clone`

If you open your repository, you should see a green *Code* button:

![](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-20363/images/help/repository/code-button.png){.border fig-alt="the green code button on GitHub" fig-align="center" width="400"}

Click on this to get your `url`:

![](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-36330/images/help/repository/https-url-clone.png){.border fig-alt="git clone URL for a repo" fig-align="center" width="400"}

It should look something like `git@github.com:some-username/r-intro-exercises.git` or `https://github.com/some-username/r-intro-exercises.git`

Copy this, and go to the terminal / command line on your machine, and run the following:

``` bash
git clone PASTE_YOUR_URL_HERE
```

You should see something like the following:

    Cloning into 'r-intro-exercises'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 16, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (16/16), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
    remote: Total 16 (delta 0), reused 16 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Receiving objects: 100% (16/16), 8.14 KiB | 8.14 MiB/s, done.

Then navigate to that folder by running the following in your terminal:

``` bash
cd r-intro-exercises
```

You are now inside a directory which is a copy of the remote repository on your GitHub. You will be making changes to the files in these directories locally and pushing them back to your remote repository once you're happy with them.

#### Opening the project in RStudio

Next you'll want to open the project in RStudio.

Fire up RStudio and click on the menu in the top right, then `Open Project…`

![](images/paste-575F7103.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

Navigate to the directory where you cloned your repository above, and select the `.Rproj` file within it.

If you have any issues opening this project, take a look at this help documentation from [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects).

When you first open the project, you'll see some output in the R console like this:

``` bash
renv library out of date - automatically restoring...
The following package(s) will be updated:

# CRAN ===============================
- R6           [* -> 2.5.1]
- brio         [* -> 1.1.3]
...
...
...
- waldo        [* -> 0.4.0]
- withr        [* -> 2.5.0]

Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: 
```

Type `y` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Go back to your terminal / command prompt and run:

``` bash
Rscript test.R --example
```

This should output something like the following:

``` bash
══ Testing test-exercises_000.R ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[ FAIL 3 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 0 ]

── Failure (test-exercises_000.R:4:3): dbl_fun works ───────────────────────────
dbl_fun(2) not equal to 4.
target is NULL, current is numeric

── Failure (test-exercises_000.R:5:3): dbl_fun works ───────────────────────────
dbl_fun(100) not equal to 200.
target is NULL, current is numeric

── Failure (test-exercises_000.R:6:3): dbl_fun works ───────────────────────────
dbl_fun(402) not equal to 804.
target is NULL, current is numeric

[ FAIL 3 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 0 ]
```

Don't worry that these are all failing at the moment: we will be fixing these problems momentarily.

### `git status`

For a command which technically does nothing, `git status` is very important. It is incredibly easy to cause a lot of damage to your project by running certain commands whilst making assumptions (but not checking) what the current status of your repository is.

::: callout-important
As a rule of thumb, try to run `git status` before and after *any other Git operation*. It could save you a lot of heartache.
:::

You run it by running the following in your terminal / command prompt:

``` bash
git status
```

You should get output which looks something like this:

    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    nothing to commit, working tree clean

This means that you haven't done anything locally beyond that which exists in the remote repository.

Before we continue, it is worth understanding the workflow of Git, by looking at the following diagram, from the Git documentation[^2]

[^2]: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F>

![](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

You start over on the left: in your working directory, with no changes to your existing files. Then, you make changes to your files, and you save them. At this point, you have done nothing different than you would when making incremental changes to (say) a Microsoft Word document.

::: callout-caution
Probably don't use Git to manage projects with Microsoft Word documents: they might look like it, but they are not just text files.
:::

### `git add`

`git add` is the command you use to add modified files to the *Staging Area*. In order for it to do anything, you first need to modify a file.

Open up `exercises/exercises_000.R` in RStudio in your cloned repository, and you should see the following:

``` r
#' make changes to the function below to make it double any number
dbl_fun <- function(number) {
  # REMOVE THE # at the start of the line below to fix your errors
  # number * 2
}
```

In R scripts (as we will learn) adding a `#` at the start of a line of code *comments out* that line: meaning you can write anything you want and the R interpreter will ignore it.

The reason the tests were failing is that the body of the function is commented out - fix it by removing the `#` and saving the file.

If you run `git status` at this point, you'd might see something like the following:

``` bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   exercises/exercises_000.R
```

This tells us that one existing file -- which Git was tracking -- has been modified. However, we are still at the very left hand side of the diagram above. The next step is to *stage* these changes. To do that, you need `git add` .

You can add individual files:

``` bash
git add exercises/exercises_000.R
```

or you can add a fileglob (in this case: all files with a `.R` extension):

``` bash
git add **/*.R
```

or you can add everything in the directory:

``` bash
git add --all
# or
git add .
```

Now, `git status` will show something like this:

``` bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   exercises/exercises_000.R
```

This output says there are changes to be committed - this is the final stage in the `git` workflow.

### `git commit`
